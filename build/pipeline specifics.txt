VIDEO - Optical system can handle:
maxEV at f/9: EV13.3 at 1/100, ISO 80
maxEV at f/9: EV12.3 at 1/50, ISO 80
minEV at f/2.0: EV2.6 at 1/24, ISO 1600
 
PHOTO - DAY
f/2.0 limit = EV12.3 (1/1000, ISO 80)
f/9 limit = EV16.6 (1/1000, ISO 80)
  
PHOTO - NIGHT (no flash)
crisp    f/2.0 limit = EV3.6 (1/50, ISO 1600)
blur     f/2.0 limit = EV0.3 (1/5, ISO 1600)
long ex. f/2.0 limit = EV-2.0 (1, ISO 1600)
  
VIDEO - DAY (f/2.0)
smooth   f/2.0 limit = EV8.2 at 1/60, ISO 80
choppy   f/2.0 limit = EV9.0 at 1/100, ISO 80
  
VIDEO - DAY (f/9)
smooth   f/9 limit = EV12.6 at 1/60, ISO 80
choppy   f/9 limit = EV13.3 at 1/100, ISO 80
  
VIDEO - NIGHT (f/2.0)
smooth   f/2.0 limit = EV3.6 at 1/50, ISO 1600
smear?   f/2.0 limit = EV2.6 at 1/24, ISO 1600
noisy?   f/2.0 limit = EV1.6 at 1/24, ISO 3200
